# Summary




# Statement of Need


# State of the Field
There are myriad open- and closed-source energy system optimization models
(ESOMs) available `@pfenninger_openmod_nodate`. ESOMs can be used for a variety
of tasks but are most frequently used for prescriptive analyses
meant to guide decision-makers in planning processes. However, despite the many available models, all of these tools share two important characteristics: Single objective optimization and an economic objective (either cost minimization or social welfare maximization). Simultaneously, there is growing awareness of energy justice and calls for its inclusion in energy models.
